        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gizdodo is a simple side dish that is often served with rice; especially Jollof rice.

            It is easy to deduce from the name that I will combine gizzards and ripe plantain in this recipe.
            
            Hence Gizdodo (Gizzard Dodo) and we all know that dodo is just another name for ripe plantain.
            
            It makes perfect sense right? I donâ€™t know who actually coined that word but I think it is epic! ðŸ˜€</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Giant-sized ripe plantain</li>
                <li>Chicken or Turkey Gizzard (500g)</li>
                <li>4 cups of sliced tomatoes</li>
                <li>Half cup of sliced pepper (scotch bonnet)</li>
                <li>1 cup of sliced onions</li>
                <li>One cup of sliced green pepper</li>
                <li>2 Seasoning cubes</li>
                <li>150 ml vegetable oil</li>
                <p>Salt to taste</p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the gizzards with hot water and precook for 20 minutes. Use a seasoning cube, half teaspoon of salt and half cup of sliced onions.</li>
                <li>Check to see that the gizzard is soft and chop to smaller bits.</li>
                <li>Fry the plantain with 400ml of vegetable oil until it turns golden, scoop into a sieve and allow it to sit for a while.</li>
                <li>Reduce the oil to 150 ml and fry the chopped gizzard. The gizzard would be dark-brown when it is properly fried.</li>
                <li>Remove the gizzards when it is fried and pour in the remaining half cup of onions, stir and add the tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced pepper and allow it to fry for 10-15 minutes. Remember to stir occasionally so it doesnâ€™t get burnt.</li>
                <li>Once the tomato is properly fried, you are almost done with making gizdodo. Add one seasoning cube to it and salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Transfer the fried gizzards, plantain, and sliced green peppers.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of salt, stir all together and taste for salt.</li>
                <li>Allow to simmer for 3 minutes then serve hot.</li>

                </ol>
